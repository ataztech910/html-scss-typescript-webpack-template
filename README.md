# HTML + SCSS + TypeScript + Webpack

This is a template repository for your next freelance front-end project. The idea of this template project is to provide frontend developers with the possibility to have a quick start without a long setup of the environments.

##The problems that are solving this template:
1. Combine styles with javascript files in one bundle for the easy implementation
2. Use TypeScript advantages in your next project
3. Use SCSS advantages like variables, mixins, and special expressions instead of CSS

##Use cases:
1. For example we need to make a quick fix for the big legacy code and to override the styles and JS code we need to search for all files make changes and then deploy. Instead, we can create a fast patch in one JS file and update the side as a quick solution
2. For example we need to see changes on the current site but we do not have access to it for some reason and need to wait for the security team. Instead, we can create the JS patch file and test it using some browser extension that can implement JS code into the page in real-time,
   E.g. this one https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/run-javascript/lmilalhkkdhfieeienjbiicclobibjao

##Technical specifications:
1. We use Yarn over NPM for the performance
2. This is a one-file solution: 1 HTML, 1 SCSS, and 1 TS file. To make an upgrade you can import files into one or update the Webpack configuration

❤ Use it with love ❤
